# Kickstarter_Analysis_Danni-Yang
Module 1 Challenge of Data Analysis Boot Camp
## Overview of Project
This project is aim to helping Louise to find out how different campaigns fared in realtion to their launch dates nad funding goals. Thus, this project demonstrates Kickstarter datasets accordingly via visualizations. 
## Analysis and Challenges
I followed the instructions and online virtual class to combed through Kickstarter datasets. Use filter, pivot table and pivot chart to visualize theater outcomes by launch dates, use countifs function to find out whether there is any relations between outcomes and goals.
The most challenged things I found during this assighment is to check and debug things I created. Even a tiny small error could lead to a very different result, which is far away from the "truth". Thus, I must keep concentrated all the time and be patient to fix my errors.
## Results
### Two conclusions based on Outcomes by Launch Date
1.Campaigns launched in May are most likely to get successful. 
2.Campaigns launched in December are least likely to get successful. 
### One conclusion is made about the Outcomes based on Goals
Higher crowdfunding goals is harder to get. Making goals within $1000 is more like to be successful.
### Limitations
The Kickstarter datasets also includes some live campaigns, which are not calculated in this project. I think it would be better to wait for all the campaigns complete their crowdfunding plan and then update the analysis.
### Recommendations
To find out further information about goals and money pledged, check worksheet Descriptive Statistics.
